## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 for markup
- CSS3 Using Flexbox and Grid for design and responsiveness
- Javascript (VanillaJS) for animation and interactive functionality

### What I learned

I learned more about Javascript DOM Object **MouseEvent** as I had to use it for animation when user switches section. Moreover, I got to know the difference between similar-looking mouse events like *mouseover*, *mouseup*, *mouseenter*. Also realized that backdrop-filter CSS property isn't supported by firefox/mozilla yet. Overall this project improved and challenged my designing skills a lot.
